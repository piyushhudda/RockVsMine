## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on its sonar signal. Logistic regression is used due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset, which contains 208 instances and 60 features. Each feature represents the energy of a sonar signal at a specific angle. The dataset is available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb
```

or

```bash
python Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.py
```

## Model

The logistic regression model is used for this binary classification task. The key steps involved in building the model include:

1. Loading and preprocessing the data
2. Splitting the data into training and test sets
3. Training the logistic regression model on the training set
4. Evaluating the model on the test set

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
